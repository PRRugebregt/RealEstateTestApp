This is a UIKit Real estate app that I made for an assignment. 

It uses a MockNetwork class to fetch data from a JSON file in the Bundle. I've used CoreLocation, MapKit, URLSession, CoreData to display the houses and implement all the features. 

I've used MVVM as the architecture with Boxing. Dependency injection is done by the TabBarController.

There are some basic unit tests as well. 

This app is just for showcasing.
